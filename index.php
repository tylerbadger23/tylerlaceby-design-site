        <h2>What I Do For my Clients</h2>
        <p>I help businesses reach their goals, whether that be by getting more sales through their store, increasing the number of inquiries or 
            getting more traffic to their site. I don't just design to make it look pretty. A big part of my job is to find solutions to problems clients have.

            <div class="content">
                <p>We will start by talking over your problems with your current site and discuss what goals you have. Before we do 
                    anything else I have to understand what you want to accomplish with your new website and I need to learn more 
                    about your current brand. Then we will go over what assets you already have in place including images, logo, 
                    color palette, etc.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Research is a vital part of the process. Here I will collaborate with you and see what your competitors are doing 
                    and how we can do it better. We will also decide what not to do. I will see what you like from other websites and 
                    don't like and why. This gives me a good understanding of where the direction is going to go and what 
                    to keep in mind when designing the site.I will then turn these ideas and research into  wireframes and mockups. 
                    Here you will get a few revisions, and we will layout the structure of the website. Finally, I will turn that into a
                     high resolution wireframe. and with your approval  we will begin development.</p>

                <p>Development is where I take the design and translate it into a fully functional website. Here I will focus on
                     the search engine optimization and making the site fully responsive for all screen sizes. We will link it to 
                     your custom domain name and then deploy for the whole world to see.</p>
