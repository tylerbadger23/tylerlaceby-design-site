            <p>I offer many services but here are my main services. If you have any questions send me and email and I will answer them right
                away.

                    <p>Do you have a sketch or photoshop document but need a developer to convert it to a pixel perfect website? If yes then I'm here to
                         help.</p>

                    <h3>UX Design</h3>
                    <p>Every website that I build has User Experience (UX) in mind. If the website looks good but doesn't function like
                         it is supposed to then there is no point in having that website in the first place. I will work with your goals in mind to get the user 
                         where you want them to be.</p>

                    <h3>Responsive Design</h3>
                    <p>Every website I build has responsive design in mind. Over 30% of users of the web use mobile devices to view websites. 
                        So shouldn't they work for mobile? Yes and when I build them they do! </p>

                    <h3>Design & Development</h3>
                    <p>I dont just design your website I also develop it too. That saves time and money since you dont have to hire a 
                    developer to build the site.</p>
